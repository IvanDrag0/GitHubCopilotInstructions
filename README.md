# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Code and test generation instructions that I use with GitHub Copilot.

Some of it is based on the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot-in-visual-studio-code). But a lot of it is based on my own experience and style.

Feel free to send ideas for improvement!
