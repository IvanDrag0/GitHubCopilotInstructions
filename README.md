# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Code and test generation instructions that I use with GitHub Copilot.

Some of it is based on the [this](https://poshcode.gitbook.io/powershell-practice-and-style/style-guide/code-layout-and-formatting) guide. But a lot of it is based on my own experience and style.

Feel free to send ideas for improvement!
